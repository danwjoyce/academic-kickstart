	abstract = {Contemporary theories propose that dysregulation of emotional perception is involved in the aetiology of psychosis. 298 healthy adolescents were assessed at age 14- and 19-years using fMRI while performing a facial emotion task. Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) were assessed with the CAPE-42 questionnaire at age 19. The high PLEs group at age 19 years exhibited an enhanced response in right insular cortex and decreased response in right prefrontal, right parahippocampal and left striatal regions; also, a gradient of decreasing response to emotional faces with age, from 14 to 19 years, in the right parahippocampal region and left insular cortical area. The right insula demonstrated an increasing response to emotional faces with increasing age in the low PLEs group, and a decreasing response over time in the high PLEs group. The change in parahippocampal/amygdala and insula responses during the perception of emotional faces in adolescents with high PLEs between the ages of 14 and 19 suggests a potential 'aberrant' neurodevelopmental trajectory for critical limbic areas. Our findings emphasize the role of the frontal and limbic areas in the aetiology of psychotic symptoms, in subjects without the illness phenotype and the confounds introduced by antipsychotic medication.},

	abstract = {The last decade’s growth in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical methods for high-dimensional data has driven a zeitgeist of prediction (or forecasting) in medicine and psychiatry. Algorithms for prediction require a model that is governed by parameters whose values are estimated from exemplar training cases. Estimation (or training) of parameters ingrains uncertainty into the resulting algorithm arising from model assumptions in addition to bias and error in the data. The trained algorithm’s proficiency is tested on separate validation cases (not seen during training) and summarized as representative of the expected performance when used for making predictions about actual patients. The trained model yields a continuous score that is proportional to the probability of some outcome, commonly a diagnosis or the occurrence of an event. Most often, this continuous score is compared with an operating threshold (or cutoff) that implicitly defines a dichotomizing decision rule because this is compatible with summary measures of performance (SMP) such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity/specificity, and balanced accuracy. Sometimes, the continuous scores are instead summarized as the Brier score, ranging from 0 (perfect) to 1 (worst). In this Viewpoint, we discuss an important but neglected issue: summary measures of performance obscure uncertainty in the algorithm’s predictions that may be relevant when deployed for clinical decision-making.},

	abstract = {Early identification of symptoms that can predict treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) could help clinicians to avoid delays in clozapine therapy. This study aims to investigate symptom patterns that could predict TRS using a discovery/replication study design. First, we followed a cohort of inpatients with schizophrenia (n = 164) in which the most discriminative items at baseline of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were determined using logistic regression with TRS status as an outcome. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, we tested the prediction performance of multiple combinations of the identified items. The same items' combination was tested in an independent replication sample of (n = 207) outpatients with schizophrenia. In the discovery sample, the best combination to predict TRS at the discharge was the sum of three baseline PANSS items – conceptual disorganization (P2), difficulty in abstract thinking (N5), and unusual thought content (G9). The P2 + N5 + G9 model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881, a sensitivity of 77.8\%, and a specificity of 83.3\%. In the outpatient sample, the model P2 + N5 + G9 predictive accuracy for TRS was only in the range of “acceptable” with an AUC of 0.756 and sensitivity of 72.3\% and a specificity of 74.4\%. Overall, the P2 + N5 + G9 model corresponds to the construct of formal thought disorder composed of disorganized thinking, concrete thinking, and bizarre-idiosyncratic thinking. Pronounced levels of these symptoms are easily identifiable in clinical practice and may be a feasible strategy in TRS. Replicating in first-episode cohorts is desirable to understand the likely clinical utility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A relationship between non-neurological autoimmune (NNAI) disorders and psychosis has been widely reported but not yet subjected to meta-analysis. We conducted the first meta-analysis examining the association between NNAI disorders and psychosis and investigated the effect of 1) temporality (as determined by study design), 2) psychiatric diagnosis, and 3) specific autoimmune disorders. METHODS: Major databases were searched for articles published until April 2018; 31 studies, comprising data for {\textgreater}25 million individuals, were eligible. Using random-effects models, we examined the overall association between all NNAI disorders and psychosis; rheumatoid arthritis was examined separately given the well-established negative association with psychosis. Stratified analyses investigated the effect of temporality, psychiatric diagnosis, and specific NNAI disorders. RESULTS: We observed a positive overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.41) that was consistent across study designs and psychiatric diagnoses; however, considerable heterogeneity was detected (I(2) = 88.08). Patterns varied across individual NNAI disorders; associations were positive for pernicious anemia (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.29-2.84), pemphigoid (OR = 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.62-2.24), psoriasis (OR = 1.70; 95\% CI, 1.51-1.91), celiac disease (OR = 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.10), and Graves' disease (OR = 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.72) and negative for ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.98) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a positive overall association between NNAI disorders and psychosis, this was not consistent across all NNAI disorders. Specific factors, including distinct inflammatory pathways, genetic influences, autoantibodies targeting brain proteins, and exposure to corticosteroid treatment, may therefore underlie  this association.},

We addressed this issue by conducting a systematic review. Embase, Medline, and PsychINFO databases were searched for studies that measured exacerbations of psychotic disorders in relation to the menstrual cycle. We extracted exacerbation measure, definition of menstrual cycle phase, and measurement of menstrual cycle phase. Standard incidence ratios were calculated for the perimenstrual phase based on the observed admissions during this phase divided by the expected number of admissions if the menstrual cycle had no effect. Random effects models were used to examine pooled rates of psychiatric admission in the perimenstrual phase. Nineteen studies, comprising 1193 participants were eligible for inclusion. Eleven studies examined psychiatric admission rates, 5 examined symptoms scores, 2 examined self-reported exacerbation, and 1 examined both admission rates and symptom scores. A random effects model demonstrated the rate of admissions during the perimenstrual phase was 1.48 times higher than expected (95\% CI: 1.31–1.67), with no significant heterogeneity detected. Four of six symptom score studies reported perimenstrual worsening, but lack of consistency in timepoints precluded meta-analysis. Two studies examining self-reported menstrual exacerbations reported prevalences ranging from 20\% to 32.4\%. Psychiatric admission rates are significantly higher than expected during the perimenstrual phase. There is some evidence that a worsening of psychotic symptoms also occurs during this phase, but further research with more precise measurement of the menstrual cycle and symptomatology is required.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials in psychiatry inherit methods for design and statistical analysis from evidence-based medicine. However, trials in other clinical disciplines benefit from a more specific relationship between instruments that measure disease state (e.g. biomarkers, clinical signs), the underlying pathology and diagnosis such that primary outcomes can be readily defined. Trials in psychiatry use diagnosis (i.e. a categorical label for a syndrome) as a proxy for the underlying disorder, and outcomes are defined, for example, as a percentage change in a univariate total score on some clinical instrument. We label this approach to defining outcomes weak aggregation of disease state. Univariate measures are necessary, because statistical methodology is both tractable and well-developed for scalar outcomes, but we show that weak aggregate approaches do not capture disease state sufficiently, potentially leading to loss of information about response to intervention. We demonstrate how multivariate disease state can be captured using geometric concepts of spaces defined over routine clinical instruments, and show how clinically meaningful disease states (e.g. representing different profiles of symptoms, recovery or remission) can be  defined as prototypes (geometric locations) in these spaces. Then, we show how to derive univariate (scalar) measures, which capture patient's relationships to these prototypes and argue these represent strong aggregates of disease state that may be a better basis for outcome measures. We demonstrate our proposal using a large publically available dataset. We conclude by discussing the impact  of strong aggregates for analyses in traditional and novel trial designs.},

Contemporary models of psychosis propose that dysfunctional reward processing is involved in the cause of these clinical illnesses. Objective: To examine the neuroimaging profile of healthy adolescents at 14 and 19 years old points with PLEs, using a reward task. Design, Setting, and Participants: A community-based cohort study, using both a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, was conducted in academic centers in London, Nottingham, United Kingdom,  and Dublin, Ireland; Paris, France; and Berlin, Hamburg, Mannheim, and Dresden, Germany. A group of 1434 healthy adolescent volunteers was evaluated, and 2 subgroups were assessed at ages 14 and 19 years. Those who scored as either high  or low PLE (based on the upper and lower deciles) on the Community Assessment of  Psychic Experiences Questionnaire (CAPE-42) at age 19 years were included in the  analysis. The study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to January 1, 2017. Main  Outcomes and Measures: Participants were assessed at age 14 and 19 year points using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a monetary incentive delay reward task. A first-level model focused on 2 predefined contrasts of anticipation and feedback of a win. The second-level analysis examined activation within the reward network using an a priori-defined region of interest approach.  The main effects of group, time, and their interaction on brain activation were examined. Results: Of the 1434 adolescents, 2 groups (n = 149 each) (high PLEs, n = 149, 50 [33.6\%] male; low PLEs, n = 149, 84 [56.4\%] male) were compared at ages 14 and 19 years. Two regions within the left and right middle frontal gyri showed a main effect of time on brain activation (F1, 93 = 5.559; P = .02; F1, 93 = 5.009; P = .03, respectively); there was no main effect of group. One region within the right middle frontal gyrus demonstrated a significant time x group interaction (F1, 93 = 7.448; P = .01). Conclusion and Relevance: The findings are consistent with evidence implicating alterations in prefrontal and striatal function during reward processing in the etiology of psychosis. Given the nature  of this nonclinical sample this may reflect a combination of aberrant salience yielding abnormal experiences and a compensatory cognitive control mechanism necessary to contextualize them.},

	abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by a persistent, pervasive pattern of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Stimulant medication such as methylphenidate has an established evidence base in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD. However, it is also associated with a risk of side effects which may include decreased appetite, increased blood pressure and possible reduced growth. Monitoring physical health in children and adolescents prescribed medication for  ADHD is a key clinical responsibility and includes a number of parameters as outlined in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines. Ascertaining the centiles of physical observations is essential to put these into developmental context and accurately inform treatment decisions. This quality improvement project aimed to improve physical health monitoring in children and adolescents prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD within a large specialist urban inner-city Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Baseline data were obtained to establish the quality of physical monitoring including blood pressure, height, weight and centiles. Targeted interventions included the development of a novel web-based application designed to calculate and record centiles. We report an improvement in total proportion compliance with physical health monitoring from 24\% to 75\%. The frequency of recording baseline blood pressure centiles increased from 0\% to 62\%; recording baseline height centiles increased from 37\% to 81\% and  recording baseline weight centiles increased from 37\% to 81\%. Improvement in the  delivery of high-quality care was achieved and sustained through close collaboration with clinicians involved in the treatment pathway in order to elicit and respond effectively to feedback for improvement and codevelop interventions which were highly effective within the clinical system. We believe  this model to be replicable in other CAMHS services and ADHD clinics to improve the delivery of high-quality clinical care.},

We scanned 17 healthy volunteers  while they performed a task-switching paradigm that previously dissociated performance deficits arising from frontal lesions in comparison with Parkinson disease, as a function of the abstraction of the rules that are switched. From a  multivoxel pattern analysis by Gaussian Process Classification, we then estimated the forward (generative) model to infer regional patterns of activity that predict Switch/Repeat behavior between rule conditions. At 1000 permutations, Switch/Repeat classification accuracy for concrete rules was significant in the BG, but at chance in the frontal lobe. The inverse pattern was obtained for abstract rules, whereby the conditions were successfully discriminated in the frontal lobe but not in the BG. This double dissociation highlights the difference between cortical and subcortical contributions to cognitive control and demonstrates the utility of multivariate approaches in investigations of functions that rely on distributed and overlapping neural substrates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stratified or personalised medicine targets treatments for groups of  individuals with a disorder based on individual heterogeneity and shared factors  that influence the likelihood of response. Psychiatry has traditionally defined diagnoses by constellations of co-occurring signs and symptoms that are assigned  a categorical label (e.g. schizophrenia). Trial methodology in psychiatry has evaluated interventions targeted at these categorical entities, with diagnoses being equated to disorders. Recent insights into both the nosology and neurobiology of psychiatric disorder reveal that traditional categorical diagnoses cannot be equated with disorders. We argue that current quantitative methodology (1) inherits these categorical assumptions, (2) allows only for the discovery of average treatment response, (3) relies on composite outcome measures and (4) sacrifices valuable predictive information for stratified and personalised treatment in psychiatry. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To achieve a truly 'stratified psychiatry' we propose and then operationalise two necessary steps: first, a formal multi-dimensional representation of disorder definition and clinical state, and second, the similar redefinition of outcomes as multidimensional constructs that can expose within- and between-patient differences in response. We use the categorical diagnosis of schizophrenia-conceptualised as a label for heterogeneous disorders-as a means of introducing operational definitions of stratified psychiatry using principles from multivariate analysis. We demonstrate this framework by application to the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness dataset, showing heterogeneity in both patient clinical states and their trajectories after treatment that are lost in the traditional categorical approach with composite outcomes. We then systematically review a decade of registered clinical trials for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia highlighting existing assumptions of categorical diagnoses and aggregate outcomes while identifying a small number of  trials that could be reanalysed using our proposal. CONCLUSION: We describe quantitative methods for the development of a multi-dimensional model of clinical state, disorders and trajectories which practically realises stratified psychiatry. We highlight the potential for recovering existing trial data, the implications for stratified psychiatry in trial design and clinical treatment and finally, describe different kinds of probabilistic reasoning tools necessary to implement stratification.},

Information transfer from ventral to dorsal striatum depends on both striato-cortico-striatal and striato-nigro-striatal subcircuits, yet although the functional integrity of the former appears to track improvement of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the latter have received little experimental attention in relation to the illness. Here, in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia stratified by treatment resistance and matched controls, functional pathways involving four foci along the striatal axis were assessed to test the hypothesis  that treatment-resistant and non-refractory patients would exhibit contrasting patterns of resting striatal connectivity. Compared with non-refractory patients, treatment-resistant individuals exhibited reduced connectivity between ventral striatum and substantia nigra. Furthermore, disturbance to corticostriatal connectivity was more pervasive in treatment-resistant individuals. The occurrence of a more distributed pattern of abnormality may contribute to the failure of medication to treat symptoms in these individuals. This work strongly  supports the notion of pathophysiologic divergence between individuals with schizophrenia classified by treatment-resistance criteria.},

Seeking proof of efficacy in early Phase 1 studies in surrogate patient populations (for example, high schizotypy individuals where subtle cognitive impairment is present) has been suggested as a strategy to reduce attrition in the later stages of drug development. However, there is little agreement regarding the pattern of distribution of schizotypal features in the general population, creating uncertainty regarding the optimal control group that should be included in prospective trials. We aimed to address  this question by comparing the performance of groups derived from the general population with low, average and high schizotypy scores over a range of cognitive and oculomotor tasks. We found that tasks dependent on frontal inhibitory mechanisms (N-Back working memory and anti-saccade oculomotor tasks), as well as  a smooth-pursuit oculomotor task were sensitive to differences in the schizotypy  phenotype. In these tasks the cognitive performance of 'low schizotypes' was significantly different from 'high schizotypes' with 'average schizotypes' having an intermediate performance. These results indicate that for evaluating putative  cognition enhancers for treating schizophrenia in early-drug development studies  the maximum schizotypy effect would be achieved using a design that compares low  and high schizotypes.},

We used the sound-induced flash illusion  paradigm, which probes audiovisual integration using elementary visual and auditory cues, in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia (n=40) and matched controls (n=22). Signal detection theory analyses were performed to characterise  patients' and controls' sensitivity in distinguishing 1 and 2 flashes under varying auditory conditions. Both groups experienced significant fission illusions (whereby one visual flash, accompanied by two auditory beeps, is misperceived as two flashes) and fusion illusions (whereby two flashes, accompanied by one beep, are perceived as one flash). Patients showed significantly lower fusion illusion rates compared to HC, while the fission illusion occurred similarly frequently in both groups. However, using an SDT approach, we compared illusion conditions with unimodal visual conditions, and found that illusory visual perception was overall more strongly influenced by auditory input in HC compared to patients for both illusions. This suggests that  multisensory integration may be impaired on a low perceptual level in SZ.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clozapine is the treatment of choice for medication refractory psychosis, but it does not benefit half of those put on it. There are numerous studies of potential post-clozapine strategies, but little data to guide the order of such treatment in this common clinical challenge. We describe a naturalistic observational study in 153 patients treated by a specialist psychosis service to identify optimal pharmacotherapy practice, based on outcomes. METHODS: Medication and clinical data, based on the OPCRIT tool, were examined on admission and discharge from the national psychosis service. The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in mental state examination symptoms between admission and discharge and the association with medication on discharge. Exploratory analyses evaluated the specificity of individual medication effects on symptom clusters. RESULTS: There were fewer drugs prescribed at discharge relative to admission, suggesting an optimisation of medication, and a doubling of the number of patients treated with clozapine. Treatment with clozapine on discharge was associated with maximal decrease in symptoms from admission. In the group of patients that did not respond to clozapine monotherapy, the most effective drug combinations were clozapine augmentation with 1) sodium valproate, 2) lithium, 3) amisulpride, and 4) quetiapine. There was no support for a dose-response relationship for any drug combination. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine monotherapy is clearly the optimal medication in medication refractory schizophrenia and it is possible to maximise its use. In patients unresponsive to clozapine monotherapy, augmentation with sodium valproate, lithium, amisulpride and quetiapine, in that order, is a reasonable treatment algorithm. Reducing the number of ineffective drugs is possible without a detrimental effect on symptoms. Exploratory data indicated that clozapine was beneficial across a range of symptoms domains, whereas olanzapine was beneficial  specifically for hallucinations and lamotrigine for comorbid affective symptoms.},

OBJECTIVE:  To assess attenuation of sensory processing by self-action in individuals with schizophrenia and its relation to current symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while medicated individuals with schizophrenia (n = 19) and matched controls (n = 19) performed a factorially designed sensorimotor task in which the occurrence and relative timing of action and sensation were manipulated. The study took place at the neuroimaging research unit at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, and the Maudsley Hospital. RESULTS: In controls, a region of secondary somatosensory cortex exhibited attenuated activation when sensation and action were synchronous compared with when the former occurred after an unexpected delay or alone. By contrast, reduced attenuation was observed in the schizophrenia group, suggesting that these individuals were unable to predict the sensory consequences of their own actions. Furthermore, failure to attenuate secondary somatosensory cortex processing was predicted by current hallucinatory severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although comparably reduced attenuation has been reported in the verbal domain, this work implies that a more general physiologic deficit underlies positive symptoms of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission is implicated in a number of psychiatric illnesses characterised by disruption of reward processing and goal-directed behaviour, including schizophrenia, drug addiction and impulse control disorders associated with chronic use of dopamine agonists. Amphetamine sensitization (AS) has been proposed to model the development of this aberrant dopamine signalling and the subsequent dysregulation of incentive motivational processes. However, in humans the effects of AS on the dopamine-sensitive neural  circuitry associated with reward processing remains unclear. Here we describe the effects of acute amphetamine administration, following a sensitising dosage regime, on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in dopaminoceptive brain regions during a rewarded gambling task performed by healthy volunteers. Using a  randomised, double-blind, parallel-groups design, we found clear evidence for sensitization to the subjective effects of the drug, while rewarded reaction times were unchanged. Repeated amphetamine exposure was associated with reduced dorsal striatal BOLD signal during decision making, but enhanced ventromedial caudate activity during reward anticipation. The amygdala BOLD response to reward outcomes was blunted following repeated amphetamine exposure. Positive correlations between subjective sensitization and changes in anticipation- and outcome-related BOLD signal were seen for the caudate nucleus and amygdala, respectively. These data show for the first time in humans that AS changes the functional impact of acute stimulant exposure on the processing of reward-related information within dopaminoceptive regions. Our findings accord with pathophysiological models which implicate aberrant dopaminergic modulation of striatal and amygdala activity in psychosis and drug-related compulsive disorders.},

Accordingly, perception of the McGurk effect, by which individuals misperceive specific incongruent visual and auditory vocal cues, rests upon effective probabilistic inference. Here, we report findings from a behavioral investigation of illusory perception and related metacognitive evaluation during audiovisual integration, conducted in individuals with schizophrenia (n = 30) and control subjects (n = 24) matched in  terms of age, sex, handedness and parental occupation. Controls additionally performed the task after an oral dose of amisulpride (400 mg). Individuals with schizophrenia were observed to exhibit illusory perception less frequently than controls, despite non-significant differences in perceptual performance during control conditions. Furthermore, older individuals with schizophrenia exhibited reduced rates of illusory perception. Subsequent analysis revealed a robust inverse relationship between illness chronicity and the illusory perception rate  in this group. Controls demonstrated non-significant modulation of perception by  amisulpride; amisulpride was, however, found to elicit increases in subjective confidence in perceptual performance. Overall, these findings are consistent with the idea that impairments in probabilistic inference are exhibited in schizophrenia and exacerbated by illness chronicity. The latter suggests that associated processes are a potentially worthwhile target for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {Amphetamine sensitisation (AS) is an established animal model of the hypersensitivity to psychostimulants seen in patients with schizophrenia. AS also models the dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine signalling which has been implicated in the development of psychotic symptoms. Recent data suggest that the enhanced excitability of mesolimbic dopamine neurons in AS is driven by a hyperactivity of hippocampal (subiculum) neurons, consistent with a strong association between hippocampal dysfunction and schizophrenia. While AS can be modelled in human volunteers, its functional consequences on dopaminoceptive brain regions (i.e. striatum and hippocampus) remains unclear. Here we describe the effects of a sensitising dosage pattern of dextroamphetamine on the neural correlates of motor sequence learning in healthy volunteers, within a randomised, double-blind, parallel-groups design. Behaviourally, sensitisation was characterised by enhanced subjective responses to amphetamine but did not change  performance (i.e. learning rate) during an explicit sequence learning task. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements showed that repeated intermittent amphetamine exposure was associated with increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal within the medial temporal lobe (MTL)  (subiculum/entorhinal cortex) and midbrain, in the vicinity of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) during sequence encoding. Importantly, MTL  hyperactivity correlated with the sensitisation of amphetamine-induced attentiveness. The MTL-midbrain hyperactivity reported here mirrors observations  in sensitised rodents and is consistent with contemporary models of schizophrenia and behavioural sensitisation. These findings of meso-hippocampal hyperactivity during AS thus link pathophysiological concepts of dopamine dysregulation to cognitive models of psychosis.},

Trust is an  inherently rewarding aspect of successful social interactions and can be examined using neuroeconomic paradigms. This study was aimed at investigating the underlying neural basis of diminished trust in psychosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 20 patients with psychosis and 20 healthy control subjects during two multiple-round trust games; one with a cooperative and the other with a deceptive counterpart. An a priori region of interest analysis of the right caudate nucleus, right temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex was performed focusing on the repayment phase of the games. For regions with group differences, correlations were calculated between the haemodynamic signal change, behavioural outcomes and patients' symptoms. Patients demonstrated reduced levels of baseline trust, indicated by smaller initial investments. For the caudate nucleus, there was a significant game x group interaction, with controls showing stronger activation for the cooperative  game than patients, and no differences for the deceptive game. The temporo-parietal junction was significantly more activated in control subjects than in patients during cooperative and deceptive repayments. There were no significant group differences for the medial prefrontal cortex. Patients' reduced activation within the caudate nucleus correlated negatively with paranoia scores. The temporo-parietal junction signal was positively correlated with positive symptom scores during deceptive repayments. Reduced sensitivity to social reward  may explain the basic loss of trust in psychosis, mediated by aberrant activation of the caudate nucleus and the temporo-parietal junction.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, studies investigating the functional implications of age-related structural brain alterations have focused on higher cognitive processes; by increasing stimulus load, these studies assess behavioral and neurophysiological performance. In order to understand age-related changes in these higher cognitive processes, it is crucial to examine changes in visual and  auditory processes that are the gateways to higher cognitive functions. This study provides evidence for age-related functional decline in visual and auditory processing, and regional alterations in functional brain processing, using non-invasive neuroimaging. METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), younger (n=11; mean age=31) and older (n=10; mean age=68) adults were imaged while observing flashing checkerboard images (passive visual stimuli) and  hearing word lists (passive auditory stimuli) across varying stimuli presentation rates. RESULTS: Younger adults showed greater overall levels of temporal and occipital cortical activation than older adults for both auditory and visual stimuli. The relative change in activity as a function of stimulus presentation rate showed differences between young and older participants. In visual cortex, the older group showed a decrease in fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal magnitude as stimulus frequency increased, whereas the younger group showed a linear increase. In auditory cortex, the younger group showed a relative increase as a function of word presentation rate, while older participants showed a relatively stable magnitude of fMRI BOLD response across all rates. When analyzing participants across all ages, only the auditory cortical activation showed a continuous, monotonically decreasing BOLD signal magnitude as a function of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings show an age-related decline in demand-related, passive early sensory processing. As stimulus demand increases, visual and auditory cortex do not show increases in activity in older compared to younger people. This may negatively impact on the fidelity of information available to higher cognitive processing. Such evidence may inform future studies focused on cognitive decline in aging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with psychoses often report fixed, delusional beliefs that are sustained even in the presence of unequivocal contrary evidence. Such delusional  beliefs are the result of integrating new and old evidence inappropriately in forming a cognitive model. We propose and test a cognitive model of belief formation using experimental data from an interactive 'Rock Paper Scissors' (RPS) game. METHOD: Participants (33 controls and 27 people with schizophrenia) played  a competitive, time-pressured interactive two-player game (RPS). Participants' behavior was modeled by a generative computational model using leaky integrator and temporal difference methods. This model describes how new and old evidence is integrated to form a playing strategy to beat the opponent and to provide a mechanism for reporting confidence in one's playing strategy to win against the opponent. RESULTS: People with schizophrenia fail to appropriately model their opponent's play despite consistent (rather than random) patterns that can be exploited in the simulated opponent's play. This is manifest as a failure to weigh existing evidence appropriately against new evidence. Furthermore, participants with schizophrenia show a 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) bias, reporting successful discovery of a winning strategy with insufficient evidence.  CONCLUSIONS: The model presented suggests two tentative mechanisms in delusional  belief formation: (i) one for modeling patterns in other's behavior, where people with schizophrenia fail to use old evidence appropriately, and (ii) a metacognitive mechanism for 'confidence' in such beliefs, where people with schizophrenia overweight recent reward history in deciding on the value of beliefs about the opponent.},

However,  up to now research has failed to pin down the exact determinants of the complex and interactive processes associated with the development of trust and reciprocity in psychosis. Utilizing a novel multi-round version of an interactive trust game experiment, we show that patients with psychosis and healthy relatives with a heightened risk for the illness exhibit lower baseline levels of trust compared with healthy controls. This effect partly overlapped with a reduced general intelligence. Furthermore, patients were unable to modify their trusting  behaviour neither in response to information about the general trustworthiness of their interaction partner, nor in response to their partners' specific direct behavioural feedback. Relatives, in contrast, modified their trusting behaviour towards similar levels as healthy subjects in response to both. The results show  that behavioural flexibility in response to socially relevant information is a critical determinant of success in the instantiation and maintenance of social relationships. A lack thereof may drive social dysfunction and the progression from subclinical symptoms to a full-blown psychosis. This offers a testable mechanistic hypothesis for progression from prodrome to psychotic illness, and may provide a therapeutic avenue to grapple the psychotic symptoms of social dysfunction.},

Women who were sexually active and had undergone FGM type III differed the most from sexually active controls (P {\textless} 0.05) in their SQOL-F score. Women who were sexually inactive but who had undergone FGM reported significantly lower overall SQOL-F scores (P = 0.015) than sexually inactive controls, but were not differentiated by type of FGM. CONCLUSION: FGM significantly reduces women's sexual quality of life, based  on the results of the SQOL-F questionnaire.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are the most prevalent symptom in schizophrenia. They are associated with increased activation within the temporoparietal cortices and are refractory to pharmacological and psychological  treatment in approximately 25\% of patients. Low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the temporoparietal cortex has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing AVH in some patients, although results have varied. The cortical mechanism by which rTMS exerts its effects remain unknown, although  data from the motor system is suggestive of a local cortical inhibitory effect. We explored neuroimaging differences in healthy volunteers between application of a clinically utilized rTMS protocol and a sham rTMS equivalent when undertaking a prosodic auditory task. METHOD: Single-blind placebo controlled fMRI study of 24  healthy volunteers undertaking an auditory temporoparietal activation task, who received either right temporoparietal rTMS or sham RTMS. RESULTS: The main effect of group was bilateral inferior parietal deactivation following real rTMS. An interaction of group and task type showed deactivation during real rTMS in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), left thalamus, left postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. However, the left parietal lobe showed an increase in activation following right sided real rTMS, but this increase was specific to a non-linguistic, tone-sequence task. CONCLUSION: rTMS does cause local inhibitory  effects, not only in the underlying region of application, but also in functionally connected cortical regions. However, there is also a related, task dependent, increase in activation within selected cortical areas in the contralateral hemisphere; these are likely to reflect compensatory mechanisms, and such cortical activation may in some cases contribute to, or retard, some of  the therapeutic effects seen with rTMS.},

This paper asks how they do so, and what brain mechanisms underlie this process. In two experiments employing behavioural and eye tracking methodologies we examined the  effects of spatial language on people's judgements and parsing of a visual scene. The results underscore previous claims regarding the importance of object function in spatial language, but also show how spatial language differentially directs attention during examination of a visual scene. We discuss implications for existing models of spatial language, with associated brain mechanisms.},

	abstract = {When accepting a parcel from another person, we are able to use information about that person's movement to estimate in advance the weight of the parcel, that is,  to judge its weight from observed action. Perceptual weight judgment provides a powerful method to study our interpretation of other people's actions, but it is  not known what sources of information are used in judging weight. We have manipulated full form videos to obtain precise control of the perceived kinematics of a box lifting action, and use this technique to explore the kinematic cues that affect weight judgment. We find that observers rely most on the duration of the lifting movement to judge weight, and make less use of the durations of the grasp phase, when the box is first gripped, or the place phase,  when the box is put down. These findings can be compared to the kinematics of natural box lifting behaviour, where we find that the duration of the grasp component is the best predictor of true box weight. The lack of accord between the optimal cues predicted by the natural behaviour and the cues actually used in the perceptual task has implications for our understanding of action observation  in terms of a motor simulation. The differences between perceptual and motor behaviour are evidence against a strong version of the motor simulation hypothesis.},
