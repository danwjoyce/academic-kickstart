This site is for hosting technical content that won't work on [my home site](https://www.danwjoyce.com).  
I split my time between clinical work in the Early Intervention in Psychosis team and the Department of Psychiatry, where I work on problems in modelling clinical state and trajectories with the intent of using these methods to better understand how treatments can be targetted to, or made more effective for, individuals.  This work draws on principles from computation, multivariate statistics and artificial intelligence / machine learning.  While I'm generally optimistic about the potential of these approaches, I'm more cautious about the current AI/ML hype.
