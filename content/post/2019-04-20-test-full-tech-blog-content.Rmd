Here's the context in clinical trials in psychiatry: To define a clinically-meaningful outcome (e.g. to a treatment/intervention) the literature frequently uses *percentage change from baseline* -- for example [@leucht2009definitions;@correctLeucht2011] in the context of PANSS scores in psychosis.  I'll avoid the debate about why this may not be appropriate for statistical modelling (e.g. using change from baseline severity rather than using the baseline as a covariate in a statistical model).  

test latex

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i} \big( \beta_{i} x_{i}  \big)
$$

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot( pressure, aes( x = temperature, y = pressure ) ) +
  geom_point()
```
